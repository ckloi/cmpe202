### Desgin Pattern

1. Composite 
2. Strategy 
3. Builder
4. Singleton

Composite pattern is to for adding nested subcomponent together. For example a burger has 5 Leafs such as Tomato, Lettuce, bacon, JALA Grilled, and Grilled Onion. Tomato and Letture is group by Vegatable, JALA Grilled and Grilled Onion groun is group by Topping, and Bacon is Meat. 

Builder pattern is used for flexiable order creation, so the Order System can combine many items to a order. For example, you can add Little Bacon Burger or Fries to an order.

Once you complete your order, Receipt and Slip is generated using its printing strategy according.

Singleton is used for helper functions to padding spaces and lines.
